# Pet The Alpaca RuneLite Plugin ü¶ô
A fun and interactive RuneLite plugin that allows you to "pet" adorable alpacas in-game and receive humorous chat messages. Keep track of how many alpacas you've petted!


# ‚ú® Features
- Pet Alpacas: Adds a "Pet" option to the right-click menu of both "Alpaca" and "Alpaca pup" NPCs in the game.
- Fun Messages: When petting, you will receive various messages in your game chat, some common and others rare and humorous!
- Pet Counter: The plugin keeps track of how many times you've petted an alpaca. You'll see the total count at special milestones and also within the plugin's settings panel.
- Instigating Messages: When you are near an alpaca, your character might "speak" something above their head, encouraging you to give it a pet!
- Player Animation: Your character will perform a small animation when petting an alpaca.
- Reset Count: In the plugin's settings, you can view and, if you wish, reset your total alpaca pet count.
